## DATASET PREPROCESSING AND MODEL BUILDING 

 I have packed the final model in Json which is in built after which I have created custom data set by creating new Data framework using  movie name , genre name, imdb score to predict the similarity. 
After extraction I worked on  K nearest neighbour Model by implementing K nearest algorithm.
